== Description ==

Set of starter files originally scaffolded by create-block, then customized to personal preferences for building WordPress blocks.

== Installation ==

1. Clone into your WordPress plugins folder.
2. Delete the .git folder from the block-starter directory you just cloned.
3. Begin adapting the files to your project. Change the folder and file names from "block-starter" to the name you chose for your project-name
4. Change/replace "block-starter" with your project-name. When performing change/replace, it's helpful to indicate the folder you intend to search before you start, and exclude the build folder.
5. Change/replace other spelling variations, using case sensitivity for the searches.
6. > npm install
7. > npm run start
8. > git init and then git add and commit.
9. Create a remote git repository on bitbucket or github.
10. > git remote add origin TheReposRemoteOrigin
11. > git push -u origin main
12. Activate your new plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
